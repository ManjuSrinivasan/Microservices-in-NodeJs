# What Is Microservice Architecture?
      
      * Microservice enables developers to develop software in small pieces.
      * One of the significant features of microservices is, every part (unit) of the application can be written in different programming languages by different teams.
      * This approach is very useful for the larger teams as they can update, scale and test microservice separately.
      * The main idea behind Microservices is to create small, functional pieces of an application, which is totally contradicted to the traditional, monolithic approach where an application is developed as a whole. 
      * Microservices help organizations to unlock agility and help them achieve faster improvements than the traditional development pattern.* This technique is not new; itâ€™s a form of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) which deals with independent products, technologies, and vendors, communicating with each other over a network.

# What Is Node.Js?
    
     * Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime to build highly-scalable applications.
     * With Node.js, JavaScript entered into server-side scripting which is revolutionary in itself as JavaScript was popular for client-side scripting.
     * Due to incredibly faster performance and ability to handle concurrent requests, a number of tech giants are using Node.js in their environments across the globe including Netflix, LinkedIn, Trello, Uber, PayPal, Medium, eBay, NASA, and many more.

# Connection Between Microservice and Node.js:

    * The connection between microservice and node.js is very strong.

    * Node.js is designed to build highly-scalable apps easier through non-blocking I/O and event-driven model that makes it suitable for data-centric and real-time apps.

    * Node.js is highly suitable for real-time collaboration tools, streaming and networking apps, and data-intensive applications.

    * Microservices, on the other hand, makes it easy for the developer to create smaller services which are scalable, independent, loosely coupled, and very suitable for complex, large enterprise applications.

    * The nature and goal of both these concepts are identical at the core, making both suitable for each other. Together used, they can power highly-scalable applications and handle thousands of concurrent requests without slowing down the system.

    * Microservices and Node.js have given rise to culture like DevOps where frequent and faster deliveries are of more value than the traditional long development cycle. 
    
    * Microservices are closely associated with container orchestration, or we can say that Microservices are managed by container platform, offering a modern way to design, develop, and deploy software.
