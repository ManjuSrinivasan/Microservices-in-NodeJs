    * Node.js supports multiple Microservices framework which enables development of application based on microservices strategy.
    * Most popular among them are Senaca js.  
    * Senaca js provides a complete environment for the development of the microservice based application.


# Why Microservices with Node.JS?

        * A rich database of multiple JavaScript modules provided by Node.js simplifies the application development significantly. 
        * Software architects prefer Node.js as a technology partner for developing JSON API-based applications, I/O bound applications, data streaming applications, single-page applications, and data-intensive real-time applications.
        
# Some of the benefits are listed below.

       ## Productivity – Node.js uses NPM (node package manager) which comes up with tons of ready to use modules which speed up the development process. Node.js uses javascript as interface language so that the same language can be used for back end and front end. This saves lots of development time.

       ## Performance – Node.js event driven I/O model along with microservices strategy which can handle an extreme amount of load with lesser response time.

       ## Friendly to Developer – Node.js has vast community support and is backed by millions of developers across the globe. Node package manager (NPM) contains more than 4 million ready to use modules which serve as heaven for developers. Node.js enables faster development of applications which are easily scalable, thereby making the developer happy throughout the application development life cycle.

             * Different enterprises like Go Daddy ,Paypal, Netflix have used this strategy to create scalable applications.
