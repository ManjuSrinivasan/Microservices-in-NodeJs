# Microservices-in-NodeJs

    * Developing microservices with Node.js has become a standard today as it is easy to set up and also helps in reducing the development time.
    
    * It has a lower memory footprint and better performance than Java/C# that helps in cost optimization.

    * Since itâ€™s a lightweight technology tool, using Node.js for microservices architecture is a great choice.
    
    * One of the many variants of distributed systems is the microservices architecture, which structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. 
    
    * Services are fine-grained and the communication protocols are lightweight (like the HTTP protocol).
    
    * Highly innovative enterprises already know that Node.js and Microservices are a great combination for achieving high performance, increased productivity, reduced costs, and satisfied developers.
